# Project Name
> Bike sharing


## Table of Contents
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data processing: One hot encoding, Train-test split
* Feature selection using RFE (Recurssive Feature Elimination)
* Modelling
* Model evaluation
* Residual analysis


## General Information
Bike sharing dataset consists information over number of bikes shared in a day, along with various features that could affect number of bikes shared.
The company wants to predict numbers of bikes shared using features given in the dataset.


## Conclusions
- Linear regressiom model performs good on both test and train dataset. It can be verified based on R2 score.
- Count of bikes shared in a day can be explained using linear relationship between features such as temperature, season, holiday etc.


## Technologies Used
- Python
